Write Documentation

articles, and such.

Submit Feedback

  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `wdmtoolbox` for local development.

1. Fork the `wdmtoolbox` repo on bitbucket.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:your_bitbucket_login/wdmtoolbox.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv wdmtoolbox
    $ cd wdmtoolbox/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. For testing you also need to install tox, coverage, and flake8::

    $ pip install tox
    $ pip install coverage
    $ pip install flake8

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
tests, including testing other Python versions with tox. The 'tox'
configuration currently tests the Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 environments.::

    $ tox

   Bring the htmlcov/index.html file up into a browser to make sure that the code has appropriate test coverage.

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to bitbucket::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the bitbucket website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, and 3.3.
